Import as maven project into IDE

cd src/main/resources/public
npm install

Create Run Configuration for spring boot with main class:
com.dmytrop.GridDynamicsApplication

There are two profiles in maven config: "dev" and "realease"

Chose "dev" if you don't want to bother about building front end part(I had no time to test completely webpack build which is come with release profile)
